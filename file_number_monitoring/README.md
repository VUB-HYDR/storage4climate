# File number monitoring

As the file number has reached the quota and therefore crashed jobs in the past - this is a quick script to monitor them.

Ideally, a automatic alert would be sent if the expected breach time is within the next x hours.

## Update

This is currently being automatically updated every 15 minutes by a cron job.
